I highly recommend trying to solve it before advancing to the solution video. But if you want to follow along, no problem at all as we go through the steps!</p><p>Please keep in mind the library that is mentioned that is recommended for the project files for your Dockerfile. Our focus is going to be how to move files for the challenge, but you can submit the Dockerfile that you have used to build the container to the following classroom link here:&nbsp;<a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/FX2c953w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://classroom.github.com/a/FX2c953w</a>. </p><p>Also, you can find the challenge files here (without the docker file, in the resources) so that you can try to build your own. The Dockerfile will be included in the solution video, in the resources.</p><p>Enjoy the challenge!</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Jordan</p></p>
