Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system:</p><p>To find out more, please see the following:<a href="https://git-scm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;https://git-scm.com/</a></p><p>For anyone that does not have Git installed you can find the following steps helpful for all major OS's:&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a></p><p>In addition, if you have any questions please feel free to post them in the Q&amp;A and I'd be happy to assist. </p><p>Overall, we only briefly used git but it's such a powerful tool to know, especially for version control. As we deployed our code to Github and automated our build, in an example scenario say we had made any type of mistake. This type of version control can help us address it, and roll back to a previous version.&nbsp; For those of you who are not familiar with or would like to refresh your knowledge of some of the commands, there is an excellent cheatsheet from <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github Education</a> that can be found here:&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf</a></p><p>As always please let me know if you have any questions and enjoy the rest of the course!</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Jordan</p><p><br></p></p>
