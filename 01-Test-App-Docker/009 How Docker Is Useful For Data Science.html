Sometimes we might wonder whether the software, library, or tool will be around for the foreseeable future and one thing is certain, and that is that Docker and containers are here to stay.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Examples of Docker benefits include:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Uniform requirements</p></li><li><p>Easily shared across systems and teams</p></li><li><p>Highly scalable</p></li><li><p>Resource optimization</p></li><li><p>Isolation</p></li><li><p>Dependency management</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Docker is a tool that will help us create, deploy, run and maintain applications by utilizing containers. Docker also makes it simple to share our projects across teams, ship them to production, or demonstrate results across different machines for a client without having to worry if the code will run or if any errors will be thrown. Docker images are immutable which will allow us to focus on other important aspects of the project or presentation.</p><p><br></p><p>There are other options to share projects within Data Science. For example via Github, but the individual will need to clone the repository and then need to check if the requirements or versions are listed. Then you have to hope that the OS, environment, and library version will not cause a conflict or build an environment that will be able to run the project. Now, it may not lead to any error but with Docker all we need to do is download the Docker image and we are ready to go. We always want to eliminate the possibility of errors and maintain efficiency.</p><p><br></p><p>This leads us to a key term to keep in mind. We can simply containerize our application including the requirements such as the libraries and dependencies and then deploy it. The takeaway here is the key term:</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Replication</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For those of us in more product facing positions this can become even more important. In the industry, we might be seeing a shift in which we are seeing more Data Scientists take on job functions that can be seen as DevOps oriented or share some responsibilities that may interact with DevOps functions. CI/CD pipelines are expanding in the current market and again, Docker is here to help.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></p>
