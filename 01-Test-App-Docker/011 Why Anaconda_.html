Mainly, I’m here to help you all succeed in your goals whether they are to just learn Docker, or to help use Docker and the information from the course to land a new job, receive a promotion, or complete a project. Due to this, I think expanding on Anaconda for a quick moment will be beneficial for those of you who want to read more.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of you may be wondering why Anaconda can be helpful. First, I want to start off by mentioning that you can use another platform or IDE/IDLE. For example, I use quite a few different IDE’s depending on the type of project that I'm working on. For this course we won’t be focusing on the Python code since we are here to examine how to use Docker. As long as you can edit .py files please feel free to use whatever you would like.</p><p><br></p><p>But, if you want to follow along we will be using Anaconda and Spyder even though it may only be for brief moments. Anaconda is completely free and open source along with being very simple to set up. It’s also a great option for Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and related domains due to the entire platform being able to install and setup Spyder, Jupyter, R Studio, and Jupyterlab with a few clicks. Moreover, we are able to build new environments with different Python versions (as an example) which is always recommended when you are working with specific versions.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s ideal to set up new environments outside of the root or base environment as a means of eliminating the chance of conflict between versions. The conda package manager along with the environment option within Anaconda provide more ordered options for installing and managing libraries and packages.</p><p><br></p><p>For anyone interested in more information related to Anaconda please see the following as a general reference:</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/</a></p><p><br></p><p>You can also use other IDE’s with Anaconda:</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>I’ll see you in the next lecture!</p><p><br></p><p>Jordan</p><p><br></p></p>
